## System Overview

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **server.js** | Main entrypoint — initialises middleware, connects DB, mounts routes, bootstraps admin. |
| **models/** | Sequelize models defining Users, Flowers, Customers, Orders, and OrderItems. |
| **routes/** | Express routers handling business logic for each feature area. |
| **middleware/** | Auth guards, role-based access, and (optional) validators. |
| **logger.js** | Winston logger configuration (structured logging). |
| **config/config.js** | Loads environment variables for DB + JWT. |
| **.env** | Contains DB credentials, JWT secret, bootstrap admin credentials. |

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Authentication** | JWT-based login system for customers, staff, and admins. |
| **User Roles** | `customer`, `staff`, `admin` — with specific access levels. |
| **Flower Management** | CRUD operations for inventory (staff/admin only). |
| **Customer Management** | View or deactivate customers (staff/admin only). |
| **Order System** | Customers can place orders; staff/admins can manage them. |
| **Reports** | Sales and stock summary reports (admin only). |

## Boot Process

1. **Database Connection**
   - Sequelize connects to the configured database.
   - SQLite foreign keys are enabled (`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`).

2. **Bootstrap Admin**
   - If no admin exists, one is created automatically using env variables.

3. **Server Start**
   - Express server launches at the configured port (default `3002`).
   - All routes are mounted under `/api/v1`.
